Welcome to  your first Artificial Intelligence project.

In this project, you will build a deep neural network from end to end and you will use it to classify images.

There are 5 Python notebooks to complete.
Each of these notebooks will bring you one step closer to the final result:
1- numpy and tensors
2- logistic regression from a neural network point of view
3- classification of planar dataset
4- deep neural network from beginning to ended
5- image classification

Before starting, you need a working Anaconda Python installation on your computer.
You will access the notebooks by running the command:

c:\Home\AI\projects\p1-ml>jupyter notebook

in the directory where you have unpacked the files.
This command should open the notebooks list into your web browser.

The 4th notebook is the longest one to fill in.
You don't need its results to do the 5th one, so you can skip it if it takes too long.

Let's get started.
